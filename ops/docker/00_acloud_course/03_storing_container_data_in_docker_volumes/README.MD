## goal : store static website data into docker volumes :
Previous topic we copied data into container but when it does scale up, we are wasting huge amount of volume.
To avoid that, we put data into a volume which will be shared between containers

### lab 1 : discover anonymous docker volumes
### lab 2 : create a docker volume
### lab 3 : use the website volume
### lab 4 : clean up unused volumes
### lab 5 : backup and restore volumes
